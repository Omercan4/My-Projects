# Converting Hand Simulation to a Computer Program via Python


**Project Aim:** This project focuses on simulating queuing systems, specifically analyzing hand simulation results and validating them with computer-generated simulations.

**Definition:** It involves developing a detailed simulation of a queuing system, using both hand-calculated and computer-generated methods to understand and validate the system's behavior.

**Programming Languages Used:** Python, particularly its object-oriented programming and function capabilities, is the primary tool used in this project.

**Summary:** This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and my understanding of queuing systems. It demonstrates my ability to accurately simulate and analyze complex systems, ensuring consistency between hand-calculated and computer-generated results. My work highlights a deep grasp of simulation techniques and a strong foundation in Python's advanced features, reflecting my talents in programming and system analysis.
