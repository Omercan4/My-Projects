# Estimating the AGV Requirements for a Hypotethical Flexible Manufacturing System


**Project Aim:** This project's goal is to estimate the Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) requirements for a hypothetical flexible manufacturing system, using non-simulation analytical methods.

**Definition:** The project focuses on calculating AGV requirements using four distinct methods developed by Egbelu, assessing their effectiveness and feasibility in different manufacturing scenarios.

**Summary:** Showcasing proficiency in analytical problem-solving and engineering principles, the project applies four diverse methods to estimate AGV requirements. We effectively demonstrate critical evaluation skills by comparing these methods, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. This work not only exhibits my talent in engineering analysis but also underscores my ability to navigate complex, real-world manufacturing challenges.
