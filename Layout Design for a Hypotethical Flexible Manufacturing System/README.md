# Layout Design for a Hypotethical Flexible Manufacturing System

**Project Aim:** This project aims to design an optimal layout for a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) using heuristic algorithms to minimize manufacturing costs.

**Definition:** The project involves creating and improving an FMS layout using constructive and improvement algorithms, focusing on equipment placement for cost efficiency.

**Summary:** In this project, we demonstrated strong analytical skills in facility layout design, applying heuristic methods for optimization. Using Python for algorithm implementation and calculations, we successfully designed a cost-effective FMS layout. This work showcases my abilities in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in Python programming.
