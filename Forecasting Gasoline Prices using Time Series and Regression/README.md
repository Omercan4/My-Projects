# Forecasting Gasoline Prices using Time Series and Regression

**Project Aim:** The goal of this project is to forecast sales of unleaded and diesel gasoline using time series analysis and regression forecasting, highlighting different methodologies.

**Definition:** It involves examining trends and seasonality in gasoline sales, applying methods like ARIMA models, and comparing the effectiveness of time series analysis against regression forecasting.

**Summary:** In this project, we aimed to delve into statistical forecasting and time series analysis, utilizing R coding for our analysis. We thoroughly examined time series observations and autocorrelation functions, focusing on unleaded and diesel gasoline sales. Our approach involved applying and comparing different forecasting methods, including time series analysis and regression forecasting. We extensively used ARIMA models, optimizing predictions through a meticulous neighborhood search of initial models. Ultimately, we concluded that our comparative analysis based on accuracy metrics like RMSE and MAPE provided deep insights into the effectiveness of statistical forecasting techniques. The project demonstrates my proficiency in R programming and statistical analysis, especially in predicting market trends and analyzing data patterns.
