# Traveling Salesman Problem Solved w/Gurobi and Pulp


**Project Aim:** The project's goal is to solve the **Traveling Salesperson Problem** (TSP) for 15 and 81 cities of TÃ¼rkiye, using data from the TR81 dataset and employing various optimization techniques.

**Definition:** The project involves selecting a subset of cities, formulating the TSP, and applying different optimization strategies, such as the **Miller-Tucker-Zemlin** constraints and **Gurobi** package, to find the shortest possible route.

**Summary:** This project demonstrates my capability in solving complex optimization problems, specifically the TSP. Utilizing Python and advanced optimization tools like the Gurobi package, I effectively tackled the challenge of finding the most efficient tour across multiple cities. This work highlights my proficiency in mathematical modeling and the practical application of optimization algorithms in solving real-world problems.
