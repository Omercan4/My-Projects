# Analyzing Steady State Probability in Ergodic Markov Chains

**Project Aim:** This project seeks to calculate the steady-state probability of an ergodic Markov chain using two methods: matrix multiplication and Monte Carlo simulation with various N values.

**Definition:** It involves creating a transition probability matrix and using this matrix for both methods, aiming to observe steady-state distributions under different conditions.

**Programming Languages Used:** Python and its associated libraries are the primary tools for this assignment.

**Summary:** The project demonstrates adept skills in Python programming and statistical analysis. It includes generating transition probability matrices with and without absorbing states and applies two distinct methods for calculating steady-state probabilities. The results reveal key insights into the behavior of Markov chains under varying conditions. This work not only showcases proficiency in Python but also a deep understanding of Markov chain analysis and simulation techniques.
