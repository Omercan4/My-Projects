# Data Mining -Classification of e-Mails using R

**Project Aim:** The objective of this project is to analyze the "spam" and "Toyota Corolla" datasets using different data mining techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Definition:** This involves partitioning data into training and test sets, employing **tree-based** methods like rpart and **randomForest**, and optimizing parameters to predict outcomes more accurately.

**Programming Languages Used:** The project primarily utilizes R, showcasing expertise in its data manipulation, statistical modeling, and machine learning capabilities.

**Summary:** In this project, we demonstrate a deep understanding of data mining principles and proficiency in R. We effectively use decision tree and random forest models to analyze datasets, aiming to minimize prediction errors. Our approach includes extensive parameter tuning to enhance model performance, reflecting our skills in statistical analysis and predictive modeling.
