Project Aim: The primary objective of this study is to predict the maximum Cauchy
stress ($\sigma_{mem, max}$) in a sun sail membrane structure based 
on six variable input parameters and a surrogate model. By utilizing a space-filling design
of 200 observations, it is aimed to build a robust and precise mathematical approximation model. Therefore it will be enabled to move beyond Newton’s principle of parsimony, which assumes 
the simplest explanation is always best, to a model that can handle the inherent complexity of structural membrane responses
