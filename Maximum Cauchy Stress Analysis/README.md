Project Aim: The primary objective of this study is to predict the maximum Cauchy
stress ($\sigma_{mem, max}$) in a sun sail membrane structure based 
on six variable input parameters and a surrogate model. By utilizing a space-filling design
of 200 observations, it is aimed to build a robust and precise mathematical approximation model. Therefore it will be enabled to move beyond Newton’s principle of parsimony, which assumes 
the simplest explanation is always best, to a model that can handle the inherent complexity of structural membrane responses

Definition: To evaluate the reliability of the emulators and analyze the mechanical sensitivity of the sun sail, this report addresses three central research questions within a unified investigative framework. 

First, a comparative assessment of model accuracy is conducted to determine whether Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, or Gaussian Processes provides the most precise prediction of the maximum Cauchy stress ($\sigma_{mem,max}$). 

Second, a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify which of the six input parameters, which are categorized into pre-stress factors, material properties, and external loads, exerts the most significant influence on the resulting membrane stress. 

Finally, the study focuses on Distribution Characterization to define the underlying statistical distribution of the maximum Cauchy stress under stochastic input variations and to ascertain which theoretical distribution provides the best fit for the observed data.
